          This page was the product of the Final Project in the Technigo
          Frontend Bootcamp. We, Laima Duhovnaja, Malin Vannesj√∂ and Hannah
          Jesinkey, created this page to be able to share the projects that were
          created during the Bootcamp. The idea extended to include projects
          from other Bootcamps as we wanted students from all over to be able to
          take part in the platform. Now you can view projects from other
          students as well as upload your own and share them with the world!
